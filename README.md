# Benchmarking-PSO-and-GA
This repository focuses on benchmarking Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithms (GA) on various unimodal and multimodal benchmark functions. The project aims to compare the performance of these two popular metaheuristic algorithms in solving optimization problems across different complexities and dimensions.
